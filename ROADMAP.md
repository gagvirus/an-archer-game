## Roadmap

- Bug - sometimes "damage reduced" is being shown wrongfully while previewing stat changes
- Improve UI / UX on statistics screen (both global & per-game)
- Add abstraction for projectile.
  - add a new skill "fire ball" similar to regular arrows
  - add a new skill similar to barrage for fire
- Active skills
  - when the player reaches certain level (e.g. 5, 15, 25, 50), allow the player to select one of the skills
  - ~~can be enabled by clicking on correct buttons, displayed on the screen (e.g. icons on bottom-left)~~
  - ~~can be enabled by hotkeys (e.g. 1, 2, 3 etc)~~
  - different types of skills:
    - activated at once (for example damage skills, that damage at once and go to cooldown. e.g. nuke, barrage etc)
      - mana / resource requirement
      - cooldown
      - active effect - damages nearby
    - has a duration (for example freeze, scorched earth, applies effect while active):
      - duration
      - mana / resource requirement
      - cooldown
      - active effect
    - toggleable - You enable / disable them (for example "armor reduction debuff against enemies", "buff to self")
      - mana / resource requirement to activate
      - mana / resource requirement to keep active per second
      - no cooldown
      - active effect
        - buff
        - debuff
        - damage over time
  - each skill shall have a different stats:
    - duration
    - effect radius
    - cool-down
  - for start, it could be just a few, e.g.:
    - freeze
    - nuke
    - buff to self
    - debuff to enemies
